# AWS Cost Optimization Guide

## 1. **Monitor and Analyze Usage**
- Use **AWS Cost Explorer** to analyze spending patterns.
- Set up **AWS Budgets** to track usage and costs.
- Enable **Cost Anomaly Detection** for unusual spikes.

## 2. **Optimize Compute Costs**
- Use **AWS Compute Savings Plans** or **Reserved Instances (RIs)** for predictable workloads.
- Leverage **Spot Instances** for fault-tolerant workloads.
- Right-size EC2 instances using **AWS Compute Optimizer**.
- Consider **AWS Lambda** for event-driven workloads to reduce idle costs.

## 3. **Optimize Storage Costs**
- Use **S3 Lifecycle Policies** to transition infrequently accessed data to cheaper storage classes.
- Enable **S3 Intelligent-Tiering** for automatic cost optimization.
- Delete unused **EBS volumes** and snapshots.
- Use **Glacier** for long-term archiving.

## 4. **Networking Cost Optimization**
- Utilize **AWS PrivateLink** and **VPC endpoints** to minimize data transfer costs.
- Use **CloudFront** for content delivery to reduce outbound bandwidth.
- Avoid unnecessary cross-region data transfers.

## 5. **Database Cost Savings**
- Use **Aurora Serverless** for variable database workloads.
- Right-size **RDS instances** and use **Reserved Instances**.
- Consider **Amazon DynamoDB On-Demand Mode** for unpredictable workloads.
- Enable **automatic backups** but delete old, unused backups.

## 6. **Rightsizing and Deleting Unused Resources**
- Identify and delete **unused EC2 instances, EBS volumes, and load balancers**.
- Stop or schedule instances to shut down during non-peak hours.
- Use **Instance Scheduler** to automate instance start/stop.

## 7. **Optimize Licensing Costs**
- Use **AWS License Manager** to track and optimize license usage.
- Migrate workloads to **open-source alternatives** when feasible.

## 8. **Use AWS Free Tier and Credits**
- Take advantage of **AWS Free Tier** for eligible services.
- Apply **AWS promotional credits** if available.

## 9. **Enable Cost Allocation Tags**
- Use **cost allocation tags** to track spending per team, project, or environment.
- Group resources under **AWS Organizations** for better cost management.

## 10. **Automate Cost Optimization**
- Implement **AWS Auto Scaling** for dynamic resource allocation.
- Use **AWS Lambda functions** to automatically terminate unused resources.
- Set up **AWS Trusted Advisor** to get cost-saving recommendations.
